Attitude: What's Cooking Good Looking!

## Description:

Recipe Finding App. User inputs what they have in their kitchen/refrigerator/pantry and app will sort and find recipes that consist of those items. User will then be able to make a meal out of the food they have at hand and not have to go out and buy more food.   

## User Story: 

I'm a person who just got home from a long day and don't want to be anywhere other than at home, but I need to make dinner and only have a sparse collection of food at home. I'm no chef and need recipes based off what I have on hand. I will use this app and input what I have at hand. Then provide me with a recipe and also allow me to give feedback so the next user knows what went wrong and what went right.

## MVP Goals:

Build an app that will take user's ingredient input and return a recipe from those ingredients.
Allow the user to upload their own recipe as well.

## Stretch Goals:

  - 3rd Party API integration 
  - Suggestion feature based on liked recipes
  - Review Feature for recipes
  - Smart Device Integration
